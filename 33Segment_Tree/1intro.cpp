// Segment Tree is a data structure that allows efficient querying and updating of intervals or segments of an array.
// It is particularly useful for problems involving range queries, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or any other operation over a specific range of elements in an array.
// This structure enables fast query and update operations with a time complexity of O(log n), making it a powerful tool in algorithm design and optimization .

// Types of Operations:
// The operations that the segment tree can perform must be binary and associative. Some of the examples of operations are:

// Finding Range Sum Queries
// Searching index with given prefix sum
// Finding Range Maximum/Minimum
// Counting frequency of Range Maximum/Minimum
// Finding Range GCD/LCM
// Finding Range AND/OR/XOR
// Finding number of zeros in the given range or finding index of Kth zero
